    "1. This question has brought to our attention mainly because of the NBA playoffs that is currently happening. With our common interest in sports, basketball in particular, and also simply from watching Stephen Curry for the last 3 years, and seeing that Stephen Curry is often making his shots from the wing, we made the assumption that Stephen Curry is most efficient shooting from the wing behind the 3 point line. We made this assumption of behind the 3 point line strictly because it offers more points than the 2 point shot and with his incredible ability to shoot, he will be more efficient shooting from here. With this proposal, it is important in various ways. One way this is important is because with our proposal and hypothesis, this could potentially help out Stephen Curry himself to become a more efficient player as well as a better idea of how he is performing. Along with potentially helping Stephen Curry, this proposal can help defenders on preventing Stephen Curry from shooting at his  most dangerous spots on the court. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason that brought us to this question of interest was from the first article from \"The Alantic\" news article written by Terrance Ross. While reading this article, we started to wonder: why are people shooting 3 pointers instead of the long two pointers, why were people shooting so far from the paint, and so close to the 3 point line but yet settling for 2 points when a player could shoot slightly further and gain that extra point. In this article, analytics were concern of this problem and tackled on this problem while showing the successful teams such as: The Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Houston Rockets, took into consideration of this idea, and because of this, these teams began to thrive to success over the other teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another article that brought to our attention was the second article listed from ESPN. This article, similar to the one above, talked about analytics and how they are incorporated with sports. This was interesting to us because of how they ranked teams of multiple sports regarding the use of analytics and to see how successful each team is in their respective sports. \n",

After cleaning out the data that we do not need, we can then focus on his field goals made and missed throughout his last 3 seasons and plot them on a statter plot. From the scatter plot, we can then see how the data is distributed in order to make an inference on where he is most efficient and also where he mostly struggles. We plan to breaking down the scatter plot to certain zones or quandrants of the court. From there we can see percentages and field goals made to make the inference that we need but keeping in mind his high field goal percentage with only shooting little attempts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of our project will be importing the number of assists and field goals made for every game during the last 3 seasons. After importing the data, we plan to plot each stat into a chart so that we can visualize our data. After plotting the data into a chart, we want to make a line of best fit in order to make a correlation on whether or not his higher amounts of assists correlated with his higher amount of field goals made. Another dataset we plan on discussing will be the field goals made with his age. With this data, we plan on making a linear regression line so that we can make an inference on whether or not he will decay or progress as he gets older.  \n",

    "One confound, is that since we are working with so much data, in this case categoires, it will be diificult understanding and deciding which statistics to take into consideration when performing certain analysis. Therefore, we have to start with the basic data, and then work our way up towards more complex manipulations. Another confound is that our predictions may be justifle, but we won't know for certain if our models are one hundred percent accurate. In addition, we are only observing Stephen Curry's past three basketball seaons, instead of his entire NBA career.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our methods on analysis do not work out to our favoring, we will reach out to the TA's and professor for assistance. On top of that, we will gather information from other resources such as stack overflow, python tuorial videos, and the least favorable method, textbooks. If our hypothesis is incorrect, we will be bummed, but instead of trashing our work we will investigate at which point we got our data wrong( i.e. wrong axis labels, incorrect step size, used the wrong method...) Perhaps our hyothesis may in fact be false, but our project will still be able to provide interesting and insightful information. "
